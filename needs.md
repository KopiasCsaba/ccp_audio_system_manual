# Needs of the audio ministry


- Some new cables, I've replaced and retired quite a few of them (4-5) in the past months due to shaky connection issues.
- XLR/6.3mm jack adapter.
- We need a light added somewhere to shine on the preacher, we need something that has a big surface area, so that it would not blind, but we need to overcome the projector, and also the camera is noisy if it doesn't get enough light.
- A stage monitor is out of service.
- AIRBNB box for holding the console key
