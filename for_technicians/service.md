1. "Screens, projector, sockets" (close to the light switches, below the counter)
2. "Screens" (between pc screens & console)
3. "Networking"  (between pc screens & console)
4. "PC+Others" (it is below the shelf above the console)

* Above the mixing console, on the shelf you'll find the battery charger.
* Based on the labels on the charger, select the appropriate set of batteries.
* The headset should be there too.
* Press the button on the headset (see image, point #1)
* While pressing the button, slide down the back side (see image, point #2)
* Put batteries in
* Close it back
* Turn it on by long pressing the button on top (see image, point #3)
    * It should lit up green, displaying 8 on the display.
* Mute/unmute it as needed by a short(er) press. (It turns red if muted.)
    * Sometimes they ask that you unmute it and they don't need to pay attention.
    * Sometimes they know how to mute it, and they do it.
    * And sometimes they forget to unmute it, then you need to signal them.

If the service starts hours later, you can keep it turned off, and only turn it on before it is given to the preacher.

## During service

* Always make sure to mute/unmute the right combination of STAGE / PULPIT / HEADSET. 
* Only **one of these three** should be unmuted at a time, generally.

## During worship

* Constantly monitor:
    * Did you turn off the preaching mics?
    * Is the volume in a normal range?
    * Do you hear every vocalist & instrument?
    * Do you hear the drum? (From the speakers?)
    * Is there any distortion?
    * Is there anything that bothers your ear?
* **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** to hear what is really going on.

## During preaching

* Constantly monitor:
    * Is the stage turned off?
    * Only the right microphone is on? (pulpit **OR** headset, never both)
    * The volume is correct?
    * Is there any distortion?

## During worship, when someone speaks or prays

* Mute the effects! Having effect on praying or preaching is very cheesy.
* If it's too much to pay attention to, that's all right, then mute the effects once and forget it:)

## Close up
* Turn off the coffee shop TV.

* Restore all custom changes on the stage, if you made any.

* SPL METER:
    * Turn off the SPL meter.
    * Put it back onto the shelf above the console.

* Headset:
    * Take out the batteries and put them back into the charger, to the same spot they were in.
    * Put the headset back to the shelf above the console too.

* Please wait until the uploading of the recording finishes (keep the PC on).
  * Just make sure there are ?? minutes between the end of the service and turning off the PC, it sync up automatically.


* Follow the "[Turning off the audio system](../labels/turningoff.pdf)" guide posted on the mixer door.
