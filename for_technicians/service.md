# Before the service

* Make sure all mics and instruments are working.
* Set up the SPL meter.

# During service

## During preaching

* Constantly monitor:
    * Is the stage turned off?
    * Only the right microphone is on? (pulpit/headset)
    * The volume is correct?
    * Is there any distortion?
    * Does the live stream gets a correct input level?

## During worship

* Constantly monitor:
    * Did you turn off the preaching mics?
    * Is the volume in a normal range?
    * Do you hear every vocalist?
    * Do you hear every instrument?
    * Is there any distortion?
    * Is there anything that bothers your ear?
    * Doest the live stream gets the correct volume?

## During worship, when someone speaks or prays
* Mute the effects! Having effect on praying or preaching is very cheesy.
