# Before the service

* Follow the [setting up the system](settingup.md) guide.
* Mute the stage
* Mute the pulpit and the headset

## During service

Always make sure to mute/unmute the right combination of STAGE/PULPIT/HEADSET.

## During worship

* Constantly monitor:
    * Did you turn off the preaching mics?
    * Is the volume in a normal range?
    * Do you hear every vocalist & instrument?
    * Do you hear the drum? (From the speakers?)
    * Is there any distortion?
    * Is there anything that bothers your ear?
* **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** to hear what is really going on.

## During preaching

* Constantly monitor:
    * Is the stage turned off?
    * Only the right microphone is on? (pulpit/headset)
    * The volume is correct?
    * Is there any distortion?

## During worship, when someone speaks or prays

* Mute the effects! Having effect on praying or preaching is very cheesy.
* If it's too much to pay attention to, that's all right, then mute the effects once and forget it:)

## Closing up

After the event is finished, please follow the [closing up procedure](closingup.md).
