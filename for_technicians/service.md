# Before the service

* Follow the "[Setting up the system](settingup.md)" guide.
* Just to make sure, you might want to load your last saved preset, probably the "CCP Service" one (without the MAIN!). 
  * See the [rehearsal](rehearsal.md) guide on how to do that.

# During service

## During preaching

* Constantly monitor:
    * Is the stage turned off?
    * Only the right microphone is on? (pulpit/headset)
    * The volume is correct?
    * Is there any distortion?
    * Does the live stream gets a correct input level?

## During worship

* Constantly monitor:
    * Did you turn off the preaching mics?
    * Is the volume in a normal range?
    * Do you hear every vocalist?
    * Do you hear every instrument?
    * Is there any distortion?
    * Is there anything that bothers your ear?
    * Doest the live stream gets the correct volume?
* **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** to hear what is really going on.

## During worship, when someone speaks or prays
* Mute the effects! Having effect on praying or preaching is very cheesy.
* If it's too much to pay attention to, that's all right, then mute the effects once and forget it:)

# Closing up

After the event is finished, please follow the [closing up procedure](closingup.md).
