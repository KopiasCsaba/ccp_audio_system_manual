Edit the post's details:

Type in the title and description:

 * For title we use the format "Title of Sermon - Main Passage - Full name of Pastor"
 * For description, you must write something as it will not let you stream otherwise. Usually we write "Good morning church!"

2-3 minutes before the service starts, start the stream so that people can start watching.
Make sure there is no audio input yet.

# Lifecycle of streaming and things to pay attention during service
 * 2-3 minutes before the announcements start, start the live streaming
 * Pointing the camera using the presets
 * Verify the stream's health & comments (see below)
 * Stop the **RECORDING** after the pastor proclaims the blessing with the church
 * Stop the **STREAMING** after the pastor dismisses the church

# Verifying stream 
## OBS 
Bottom right of OBS:

![obs_status.png](assets%2Fvideo%2Fscreenshots%2Fobs_status.png)

It should look like this:
 * Green indicator
 * CPU < 30%
 * FPS: 60
 * Dropped frames: 0 (a few is fine, if it is going up constantly, then we have an issue)

## Facebook
The metrics should be kind-of flat, without big dips in it:

Also you want to check on the comments, if something very bad would come up, you can delete it.
If in doubt, consult an elder/leader about it.
