Edit the post's details:

![fblivedetailedit.png](assets%2Fvideo%2Fscreenshots%2Ffblivedetailedit.png)

Type in the title and description:

 * For title we use the format "Title of Sermon - Main Passage - Full name of Pastor"
 * For description, you must write something as it will not let you stream otherwise. Usually we write "Good morning church!"

# Start OBS

Start OBS:

![taskbar_obs.png](assets%2Fvideo%2Fscreenshots%2Ftaskbar_obs.png)

# Verify audio settings
 * Mic/Aux should be unmuted
 * Desktop Audio 2 should be muted
 * Upon any signal from the console, Mic/Aux should show signal
 * Desktop Audio 2 might not show a signal in the beginning. Unmute and then mute again if the signal passes through.

# Managing the the camera
 * Click on the first/only element in the list "PTZ DEVICE"
 * Double click any of the presets, to point the camera

![obs_camera.png](assets%2Fvideo%2Fscreenshots%2Fobs_camera.png)

# Start streaming in OBS
 * Make sure there is no audio coming from the console (mute headset, pulpit and turn stage off)
 * Press "Start streaming"


# Start streaming in Facebook

2-3 minutes before the service starts, start the stream so that people can start watching.
Make sure there is no audio input yet.

# Lifecycle of streaming and things to pay attention during service
 * 2-3 minutes before the announcements start, start the live streaming
 * Pointing the camera using the presets
 * Verify the stream's health & comments (see below)
 * Stop the **RECORDING** after the pastor proclaims the blessing with the church
 * Stop the **STREAMING** after the pastor dismisses the church

# Verifying stream 
## OBS 
Bottom right of OBS:

![obs_status.png](assets%2Fvideo%2Fscreenshots%2Fobs_status.png)

It should look like this:
 * Green indicator
 * CPU < 30%
 * FPS: 60
 * Dropped frames: 0 (a few is fine, if it is going up constantly, then we have an issue)

## Facebook
The metrics should be kind-of flat, without big dips in it:

![fb_network_stats.png](assets%2Fvideo%2Fscreenshots%2Ffb_network_stats.png)

Also you want to check on the comments, if something very bad would come up, you can delete it.
If in doubt, consult an elder/leader about it.
