# Prepare for going live
1. Turn on the PC & LOG IN

    2. OBS should have started automatically after login. 

# Lifecycle of the stream

### BEFORE THE CLASS STARTS
 * Select and make live the appropriate "**EVENT PRE STREAM**" scene.
 * This starts the live stream with pre-stream image/audio so people can tune in.

### WHEN THE CLASS STARTS
 * Make live the "**Pulpit**" or "**Sitting**" scene in OBS.

### WHEN GOING ON BREAK
 * Make live the "**EVENT BREAK**" scene.

### WHEN RETURNING FROM A BREAK
 * Make live the "**Pulpit**" or "**Sitting**" scene in OBS.

### AT THE END
 * Make live the "**EVENT FINISHED**" scene.
 * This will cut recording and streaming after a little delay.
 
    

# Finishing

1. Press "STOP RECORDING" in OBS.
1. Turn off the projector.
1. Close back the projector-screen.
1. Put back the little keyboard.
1. Get the headset batteries out and put them back into the charger.
1. Put the headset back to the shelf.
1. Restore the HDMI cables as they were (unplug, and reconnect the USB grabber)

1. Wait for the recordings to upload.

   **If you can**, please wait about 15 minutes to pass between "stop recording", and turning off the PC.
   The computer automatically uploads the recordings of this class, so that our crew could edit/upload/manage it.

   You can check on the status by clicking on the:
   **System tray â†’ Google Drive icon**, and verifying that a file with today's date is being/was uploaded.

# Troubleshooting

## No audio input coming to OBS

If you see, that there is no audio coming to OBS:

Sometimes the audio input device in OBS is reset to something else, than LINE IN.

1. Click on the audio input's three dots (the one that is the highest)
1. Select Properties
1. Select LINE IN
1. Press OK

## Projector colors are incorrect
Make sure to put something on the screen, e.g. a webpage or an image that you know already, and you know what colors to expect.
Don't trust the background image on macbooks.

### Just slightly off
If it is slightly off, e.g. whites are yellow, the projector's image mode is changed.

   * Using the remote controller of the projector (white, asus label), go into it's menu.
   * Image settings
   * Select sRGB.

### Very off
E.g. if many colors are changed, usually blue turns to green, many things to pink, etc.

Then on the Macbook the settings of the display must be adjusted.

 * Make sure that "True tone" is off
 * Select color profile sRGB

If nothing works, usually "mirroring" instead of "extending" fixes everything no matter what.
