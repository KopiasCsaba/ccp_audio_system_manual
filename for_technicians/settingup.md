# At the console

* Follow the "[Turning on the audio system](../labels/turningon.pdf)" guide posted on the mixer door.

## Set up the sound pressure level (SPL) meter

This device measures the volume (lets say) in the room, and it is located on the shelf above the console.

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/spl.jpg.png"  align="right" style="float:right" width="300">


* Turn it on following the numbers on the buttons.
    * The two 1-s need to be pressed together, until the "**n**" shows up.
    * Then wait until it initializes.
    * Then press 2.
    * Then press 3.

It should read "SLOW" and "C".

* Put it to the counter and watch it always.

## Put batteries into the headset

Only do this, if the headset will be used.

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/rhodelink.jpg.png"  align="right" style="float:right" width="200">

* Above the mixing console, on the shelf you'll find the battery charger.
* Based on the labels on the charger, select the appropriate set of batteries.
* The headset should be there too.
* Press the button on the headset (see image, point #1)
* While pressing the button, slide down the back side (see image, point #2)
* Put batteries in
* Close it back
* Turn it on by pressing the button on top (see image, point #3)
* Pay attention to it's muted/unmuted state, and communicate with the preacher about it.
    * Sometimes they ask that you unmute it and they don't need to pay attention
    * Sometimes they know how to mute/unmute it
    * And sometimes they forget to unmute it, then you need to signal them.

# Reset the stage

## Resetting the stage mixers

 
Reset the stage mixers, but only **BEFORE** a rehearsal. (So don't do it before a service, when they already set it up for themselves on the rehearsal.)

There is one mixer in the drum-room too, reset that one also.

The order is important here:

1. Turn it on, if it's not on (switch is on the back side)
2. Reset the top-knobs
    * Equalizers to **12 o'clock**
    * Limiter to **MAX**
    * Level to **3 o'clock**
3. Recall preset 16
    * Press and hold **RECALL**
    * Press **16**
    * **Release** RECALL

## Verify stage mixers' connections

Verify that the speakers are connected to **L/MONO**:

## Verify keyboard connection

Verify that it is connected properly, sometimes they unplug it for practicing.

## Verify stage monitor settings & connections

### Left stage monitor

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/speaker_left.png"  align="right" style="float:right" height="200">

* All 12 o'clock.
* Check power and signal cable connections, somethimes they become loose.


<br clear="right" style="clear:right"/>


### Middle stage monitor

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/speaker_middle.png"  align="right" style="float:right" height="260">

* All 12 o'clock.
* Check power and signal cable connections, somethimes they become loose.


<br clear="right" style="clear:right"/>

### Right stage monitor

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/speaker_right.png"  align="right" style="float:right" height="260">

* This one is a bit damaged, the level should be at 3 o'clock!
* Check power and signal cable connections, somethimes they become loose.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Verify Rhode link settings

(This is here for reference, if you have no reason for it, you don't need to check it always.)

* The receiver (the one on the wall) should be on 0db gain.
* The transmitter (the one with the mic) should be on 10db gain.

# Check that all is working

* Turn on the keyboard, and press one of the keys, you should hear it.
    * If not, check cables.

* Speak into each microphone, and you should hear yourself in each monitor.
    * If not:
        * check the main console, maybe the stage is off, or the mic is muted.
        * check connections, stage mixer settings (e.g.: reset it properly)
