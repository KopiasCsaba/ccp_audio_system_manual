# Reset the stage

## Resetting the stage mixers

 
Reset the stage mixers, but only **BEFORE** a rehearsal.
There is one mixer in the drum-room too, reset that one also.

The order is important here:

1. Reset the top-knobs
    * Equalizers to **12 o'clock**
    * Limiter to **MAX**
    * Level to **3 o'clock**
2. Recall preset 16
    * Press and hold **RECALL**
    * Press **16**
    * **Release** RECALL

## Verify Rhode link settings

(This is here for reference, if you have no reason for it, you don't need to check it always.)

# Check that all is working

* Turn on the keyboard, and press one of the keys, you should hear it.
    * If not, check cables.

* Speak into each microphone, and you should hear yourself in each monitor.
    * If not:
        * check the main console, maybe the stage is off, or the mic is muted.
        * check connections, stage mixer settings (e.g.: reset it properly)
