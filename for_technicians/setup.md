## Loading the scene

1. Press **{SCENES/VIEW}**.
2. Turn **{Knobs/GO}**: to scroll to the scene you want to load.
   * If this is a rehearsal: **Service READONLY**
   * If this is the service: **Service**
3. Press **{Knobs/GO}**: to load the scene.
4. Press **{Knobs/CONFIRM}**: to really load the scene.

## Other things

1. Set **{Main/Fader}** to 0.

## Set up the sound pressure level (SPL) meter

This device measures the volume (lets say) in the room, and it is located on the shelf above the console.

1. Turn it on following the handwritten numbers on the buttons.
    1. The two button marked "1"(one) need to be pressed together, until the "**n**" shows up on the screen.
    2. Then wait until it finishes the initial counting back (999,888,777...) and shows the volume in real time.
    3. Then press the button marked as 2.
    4. Then press the button marked as 3.
2. It should read "SLOW" and "C", as on the image.
3. Put it to the counter and watch it always.

# Verify stage monitor settings & connections

### Left stage monitor

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/speaker_left.png"  align="right" style="float:right" height="200">

* All 12 o'clock.
* Check power and signal cable connections, sometimes they become loose.

<br clear="both" style="clear:both"/>

### Middle stage monitor

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/speaker_middle.png"  align="right" style="float:right" height="260">

* All 12 o'clock.
* Check power and signal cable connections, sometimes they become loose.

<br clear="both" style="clear:both"/>

### Right stage monitor

<img alt="" src="assets/reset/speaker_right.png"  align="right" style="float:right" height="260">

* This one is a bit damaged, the level should be at 3 o'clock!
* Check power and signal cable connections, sometimes they become loose.

<br clear="both" style="clear:both"/>


# Check if everything is working

* Turn on the keyboard, and press one of the keys, you should hear it, from all monitors.

* Speak into each microphone, and you should see activity on the mixer, and hear yourself in each monitor.

If everything was working, continue with the [Rehearsal guide](rehearsal.md) or the [Service guide](service.md)!

If something wasn't working, check the rest of this guide on how to troubleshoot.

## Troubleshooting

If there is any issue on the stage, check these things:

### Common failures

No signal activity on the mics?

* The stage is off (on the console), that's why no microphone is working.
* The individual microphone is muted on the console.
* The stage mixer isn't on.

There is signal indication, but inaudible?

* A power or signal cable slipped out from the monitor.
* The stage mixer is disconnected.
* The limiter knob is turned down.

### Stage mixer connection

<img align="right" alt="" src="assets/reset/mixer_conn.jpg" height="100">
Verify that the speakers are connected to **L/MONO**:

### Verify keyboard connection

Verify that it is connected properly, sometimes they unplug it for practicing.
