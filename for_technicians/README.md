## Cable & microphone numbering on the stage

![stage.jpg](../for_worship_team/assets/stage.jpg)

The logic is, that:

* Close to **Mic1** is now **Inst1** and **Inst2** cables.
* Close to **Mic3** is the **Inst3** cable.
* And the stage corner has **Inst4** and **Inst5** cables.


# General notes for technicians

## Please never share the WiFi password with anyone
Our internal systems for streaming, audio, etc. are using the network, and we don't want any interruption in our network.

Often people ask for the password, feel free to give the above explanation.
If the reason is to be able to read the bible, we have bibles in many languages, point them 
to those on the shelves.
