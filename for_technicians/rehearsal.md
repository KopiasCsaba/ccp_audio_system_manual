# Before they arrive

You should be there ~20minutes before them, to be able to set up
everything professionally and to avoid hurry-induced errors, fix random issues, etc.

* Follow the "[Setting up the system](settingup.md)" guide.

## At the main console

### Load the main scene

Load the "CCP Service MAIN" scene.

This contains our default settings, please never overwrite it.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Load vocal and instrument presets

Consult with the worship leader on:

* Who will be at which mic on the stage.
* Who will use which instrument.

Based on this information...

#### Load Vocalists

* Select the **VOCALS** layer.
* **Mute** and **Pull down** unused channels.
  * Determine which vocal mics will NOT be used. (From Mic 1 to Mic 6).
  * Mute them.
  * Pull them down.
* Load the appropriate preset for the channels, see: Loading a preset.

#### Load Instruments

* Select the **Instruments** layer.
* **Mute** and **Pull down** unused channels.
  * Determine which instrument cables will NOT be used. (From Instrument 1 to 5)
  * Mute them
  * Pull them down
  * Don't change/mute the piano, DrumTB and the other stuff.
* Load the appropriate preset for the channels, see: Loading a preset.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Loading a preset


* Press the **SELECT** button on the channel you want to load.
* Press the **VIEW** button on the EQUALIZER section on the mixer.
  * It might not be needed, if you pressed it already earlier.
  
* Press the **UTILITY** button next to the screen.

document on how.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Other things

* Mute the preaching mics, to avoid feedback.

## At the stage

* Reset the stage (see: [Setting up the system](settingup.md))
* Set up stage to be usable by the musicians
    * Set up correct mic heights
    * Move away obstacles
    * Fold back unused microphones
    * Check stands
    * Check monitor alignments


# After they arrive

* Be nice, connect with them personally.
* Help them with what ever they ask.
* **Align the microphones**
    * Very important!
    * Align height and direction, so that the microphone is in line with the mouth, and points towards them. Ideally it
      points bottom up.
    * Meanwhile, keep it in a way so that the sound from the monitor would hit the microphone from the back as much as
      possible.
* **Ask them to set instrument controls to neutral**
    * Some instruments have equalizers on them, ask the owner to turn it off, or set it to "flat".
    * Some instruments have volume controls on them, ask the owner to set it to neutral, or middle.
    * And ask the owners of the instruments, not to change any of those during performing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


## Gain staging

* Set the Main fader to 0.
* Usually no need to gain-stage the drums and the keyboard.
* Go through Mics 1-6, Instruments 1-5 and set a proper gain on the used channels.

### How to set the gain
* In order to set the gain level, we must have input.
  * Ask them one-by-one to play or sing from lowest to highest volume.
    * You only really care about their highest volume levels, but asking from lowest to highest usually helps them in producing more precise
      levels.
  * Alternatively you can do this while they play.
  * But make sure to set the gain when a normal, regular input is coming through.

<img src="assets/console/gainstaging.png" height="300"/>

* Press the **SELECT** button on the channel you are setting the gain on.
  * See image, point #1.
* Watch the channel strip's meter 
* See image, point #2.
* When the input is around it's the highest level, it should be around the **-18db** mark.
* If it needs adjustment, then the turn the "GAIN" knob at the console's top left corner.
  * Do it until the signal jumps around -18 db.
  * See image, point #2.
* **Usually, channel gain should not be changed after this point.**



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## During worship

* Constantly monitor that everything sounds right.
    * **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** of the cave for that!
* Check if the vocalists have the microphone aligned well.
* Set up a mix that sounds well while keeping eye on the SPL meter, the limits are written on it.
  * The lead singer should be a bit louder than the other vocalists.
* Check if they need any help, e.g.:
    * Stuck cables
    * Microphone alignment
    * Volume issues
* Verify that the stage isn't too loud
    * Sometimes mute the MAIN channel, to see if the stage is too loud or if one source is overpowering the others on
      the stage.
    * If an instrument or vocalist fills the room just from the monitors, ask them or help them adjust it.
* PUT YOUR HEAD OUT of the cave! :)

### If a vocalist sounds off-key or unexpected

Our singers are quite good and checked, so if they sound bad,
that is most likely due to them not hearing themselves correctly.

To solve this: go up on the stage and check the monitor levels.
The target is for them to be a bit louder.

* Either increase the overall monitor level
* Or increase their level in the monitor
* Or lower something that is too loud

An alternative reason can be:

* An overworking compressor on the channel
* A too high (or low) low-cut
* An unfortunate equalizer setting

# After the rehearsal

## Save the scene

* We have one preset that we never overwrite, that is the **CCP Service MAIN**.
* We load it, but we save it over on the **CCP Service**.
* Never overwrite the MAIN one please.

On the console:

* Press **VIEW** at the "Scenes" section.
* With the "Save" knob, scroll to the "**CCP Service**" (without the "<ins>MAIN</ins>").
* Press the knob to save it.
* Press the "backspace" knob to delete "MAIN" from the name, if needed.
* Press the "save" knob.
* Press confirm.

## Closing up

After the event is finished, please follow the [closing up procedure](closingup.md).
