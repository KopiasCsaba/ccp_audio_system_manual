# Reference on stage channel numbers

<img src="../for_worship_team/assets/stage.jpg" height="400"/>

The logic is, that:

* Close to **Mic1** is now **Inst1** and **Inst2** cables.
* Close to **Mic3** is the **Inst3** cable.
* And the stage corner has **Inst4** and **Inst5** cables.

# Before they arrive

You should be there ~20minutes before them, to be able to set up
everything professionally and to avoid hurry-induced errors, fix random issues, etc.

* Follow the "[Setting up the system](settingup.md)" guide.

# At the stage

* Set up correct mic heights.
* Check microphone alignments.
* Check monitor alignments.
* Fold back unused microphones.
* Turn down (turn level knob to zero) on monitors that will not be used.

## At the main console

### Load the main scene

Load the "CCP Service MAIN" scene.

This contains our default settings, please never overwrite it.

* Press **VIEW** at the "Scenes" section of the mixer.
* By turning the "GO" knob, **SELECT** to the "CCP Service MAIN".
* **Press** the knob to load it.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Other things

* Mute the preaching mics, to avoid feedback.
* Set the Main fader to 0.
* Turn on the stage.

### Load vocal and instrument presets

Consult with the worship leader on:

* Who will be at which mic on the stage.
* Who will use which instrument.

Based on this information...

#### Load Vocalists

* Select the **VOCALS** layer.
* Between Vocal channel 1-6: **mute** and **pull down** unused channels.
    * Do not change channel 7 and 8.
* Load the appropriate preset for the channels, see: [Loading a preset](#loading-a-preset).

#### Load Instruments

* Select the **Instruments** layer.
* Between Instrument channels 1-5: **mute** and **pull down** unused channels.
    * Don't change/mute channels 6,7,8.
* Load the appropriate preset for the channels, see: [Loading a preset](#loading-a-preset).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Loading a preset

* Select the right **LAYER**.
* Press the **SELECT** button on the channel you want to load.
* Press the **VIEW** button on the EQUALIZER section on the mixer.
    * It might not be needed, if you pressed it already earlier.

* Press the **UTILITY** button next to the screen.

<img src="assets/console/presetloading.png" height="300"/>

* By turning the (first) "SCOPE" knob, select the **RECALL SCOPE**.
    * See image, point #1.

* Press the knob to select **all scopes**.
    * See image, point #2.
    * Should look like the green area.

* Select the appropriate preset by **turning** the "LOAD PRESET" knob
    * See image, point #3.
    * "VOC ..." for vocalitst
    * "GTR ..." for guitars

* Press second knob to load it.
    * See image, point #4.

* Press **confirm**

After the initial setup, you might want to save the preset, see "[Save the scene](#save-the-scene)" at the end of this
document on how.

# After they arrive

* Be nice, connect with them personally.
* Help them with what ever they ask.
* **Check vocalist-microphone alignments**
    * Very important!
    * Align height and direction, so that the microphone is in line with the mouth, and points towards them. Ideally it
      points bottom up.
    * Meanwhile, keep it in a way so that the sound from the monitor would hit the microphone from the back as much as
      possible.
  
* **Ask them to set instrument controls to neutral**
    * Some instruments have equalizers on them, ask the owner to turn it off, or set it to "flat".
    * Some instruments have volume controls on them, ask the owner to set it to neutral, or middle.
    * And ask the owners of the instruments, not to change any of those during performing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Gain staging

* Usually no need to gain-stage the drums and the keyboard.
* Go through Vocal mics 1-6 and Instruments 1-5 and set a proper gain on the used channels.

### How to set the gain

* In order to set the gain level, we must have input.
    * Ask them one-by-one to play or sing from lowest to highest volume.
        * You only really care about their highest volume levels, but asking from lowest to highest usually helps them
          in producing more precise
          levels.
    * Alternatively you can do this while they play.
    * But make sure to set the gain when a normal, regular input is coming through.

<img src="assets/console/gainstaging.png" height="300"/>

* Press the **SELECT** button on the channel you are setting the gain on.
    * See image, point #1.
* Watch the channel strip's meter
  * See image, point #2.
* When the input is around it's highest level, it should be around the **-18db** mark.
* If it needs adjustment, then the turn the "GAIN" knob at the console's top left corner.
    * Do it until the signal jumps around -18 db.
    * See image, point #2.
* **Usually, channel gain should not be changed after this point.**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## During worship

* Constantly monitor that everything sounds right.
    * **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** of the cave for that!
* Constantly check the SPL meter to keep everything in the correct volume range.
* Check if the vocalists have the microphone aligned well.
* Set up a mix that sounds well while keeping eye on the SPL meter, the limits are written on it.
    * The lead singer should be a bit louder than the other vocalists.
* Check if they need any help, e.g.:
    * Stuck cables
    * Microphone alignment
    * Volume issues
* Verify that the stage isn't too loud.
    * Sometimes mute the MAIN channel, to see if the stage is too loud or if one source is overpowering the others on
      the stage.
    * If an instrument or vocalist fills the room just from the monitors, ask them or help them adjust it.
* PUT YOUR HEAD OUT of the cave! :)
  * If you have capacity, go up to the stage while they sing, and check if:
    * Everything is balanced, everyone hears everyone.
    * Nothing is too loud.

* Did you asked the instrument players to reset their eq/volume levels?
* Do you hear all instruments?
* Do you hear all vocalists?
* Do you hear the drum?
* Is the stage too loud?

### If a vocalist sounds off-key or unexpected

Our singers are quite good and checked, so if they sound bad,
that is most likely due to them not hearing themselves correctly.

To solve this: go up on the stage and check the monitor levels.
The target is for them to be a bit louder.

* Either increase the overall monitor level
* Or increase their level in the monitor
* Or lower something that is too loud

An alternative reason can be:

* An overworking compressor on the channel
* A too high (or low) low-cut
* An unfortunate equalizer setting

# After the rehearsal

## Save the scene

* We have one preset that we never overwrite, that is the **CCP Service MAIN**.
* We load it, but we save it over on the **CCP Service**. (Thats the "weekly working preset")
* Never overwrite the MAIN one please.

On the console:

* Press **VIEW** at the "Scenes" section.
* With the "Save" knob, scroll to the "**CCP Service**" (without the "<ins>MAIN</ins>").
* Press the knob to save it.
* Press the "backspace" knob to delete "MAIN" from the name, if needed.
* Press the "save" knob.
* Press confirm.

## Closing up

After the event is finished, please follow the [closing up procedure](closingup.md).
