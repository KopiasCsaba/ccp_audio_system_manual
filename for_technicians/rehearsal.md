# Reference on stage channel numbers

The logic is, that:

* Close to **Mic1** is the **Inst1** and **Inst2** cables.
* Close to **Mic3** is the **Inst3** cable.
* And the stage corner has **Inst4** and **Inst5** cables.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Before the band arrives

You should be there ~20minutes before them, to be able to set up
everything professionally and to avoid hurry-induced errors, fix random issues, etc.

* Follow the "[Setting up the system](settingup.md)" guide.

## At the main console


### Mute pulpit and headset
* Check if the pulpit/headset is muted, and mute if needed.

### Mute unused vocals

* Select the **VOCALS** layer.
* Between Vocal channel 1-6: **mute** and **pull down** unused channels.
    * Do not change channel 7 and 8.

    
### Mute unused instruments

* Select the **INSTRUMENTS** layer.
* Between Instrument channels 1-5: **mute** and **pull down** unused channels.
    * Don't change/mute channels 6, 7, 8.



### Load vocal and instrument presets

You should know:

* Who will be at which mic on the stage.
* Who will use which instrument.

Our worship related drive document should contain that information,
but alternatively you can consult about this with the worship leader.


Based on this information continue and load the channel presets!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Loading a preset
Go through **Vocal mics 1-6** and **Instruments 1-5**, and for each used channel, load the appropriate preset, repeating the following steps:

1. Select the right **LAYER** (E.g. vocals or instruments).
2. Press the **SELECT** button on the channel you want to load.
3. Press the **VIEW** button on the EQUALIZER section on the mixer.
    * It might not be needed if it is red already: if you pressed it already earlier.

4. Press the **UTILITY** button next to the screen.

    <img src="assets/console/presetloading.png" height="200"/>

5. By turning the (first) "SCOPE" knob, select the **RECALL SCOPE**.
    * See image, point #1.

6. Press the knob to select **all scopes**.
    * See image, point #2.
    * Should look like the green area.

7. Select the appropriate preset by **turning** the "LOAD PRESET" knob
    * See image, point #3.
    * "GTR ..." for guitars
    * "VOC ..." for vocalist (you need to scroll down to find those beneath the GTR-s)

8. Press second knob to load it.
    * See image, point #4.

9. Press **confirm**

10. Repeat this section for the next vocal or instrument channel that is in use.

After the initial setup, you might want to save the scene, see "[Save the scene](#save-the-scene)" at the end of this
document on how.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


# After the band arrives

* Be nice, connect with them personally.
* Help them with what ever they ask.
* Fold back unused microphones.
* Turn down (turn level knob to zero) on monitors that will not be used.

* **Ask them to set instrument controls to neutral**
  * Some instruments have equalizers on them, ask the owner to turn it off, or set it to "flat".
  * Some instruments have volume controls on them, ask the owner to set it to neutral, or middle.
  * And ask the owners of the instruments, not to change any of those during performing.

* **Check vocalist-microphone alignments**
    * Very important!
    * Align height and direction, so that the microphone is in line with the mouth, and points towards them. Ideally it
      points bottom up.
    * Meanwhile, keep it in a way so that the sound from the monitor would hit the microphone from the back as much as
      possible.
  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Gain staging


Go through **Vocal mics 1-6** and **Instruments 1-5** and set a proper gain on the used channels (no need to gain-stage the drums and the keyboard),
by repeating the following steps on each used channel:

1. In order to set the gain level, we must have input.
    * Ask them one-by-one to play or sing from lowest to highest volume.
        * You only really care about their highest volume levels, but asking from lowest to highest usually helps them
          in producing more precise
          levels.
    * Alternatively you can do this while they play.
    * But make sure to set the gain when a normal, regular input is coming through.

2. Press the **SELECT** button on the channel you are setting the gain on.
    * See image, point #1.
3. Watch the channel strip's meter
    * See image, point #2.
4. When the input is around its highest level, it should be around the **-18db** mark.
5. If it needs adjustment, then the turn the "GAIN" knob at the console's top left corner.
    * Do it until the signal jumps around -18 db.
    * See image, point #2.

6. Repeat this section for the next vocal or instrument channel that is in use.

**Usually, channel gain should not be changed after this point.**

## During worship

* Constantly monitor that everything sounds right.
    * **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** of the cave for that!
* Constantly check the SPL meter to keep everything in the correct volume range.
* Check if the vocalists have the microphone aligned well.
* Set up a mix that sounds well while keeping eye on the SPL meter, the limits are written on it.
    * The lead singer should be a bit louder than the other vocalists.

* Check if they need any help, e.g.:
    * Stuck cables
    * Microphone alignment
    * Volume issues
  
* Verify that the stage isn't too loud.
    * Sometimes mute the MAIN channel, to see if the stage is too loud or if one source is overpowering the others on
      the stage.
    * If an instrument or vocalist fills the room just from the monitors, ask them or help them adjust it.
    * Don't mute the room for long, it disturbs the band. Mute, check, unmute.
* PUT YOUR HEAD OUT of the cave! :)

* If you have capacity, go up to the stage while they sing, and check if:
  * Everything is balanced, everyone hears everyone.
  * Nothing is too loud.

* Did you ask the instrument players to reset their eq/volume levels?
* Do you hear all instruments?
* Do you hear all vocalists?
* Do you hear the drum (from the speakers!?)

### If a vocalist sounds off-key or unexpected

Our singers are quite good and checked, so if they sound bad,
that is most likely due to them not hearing themselves correctly.

To solve this: go up on the stage and check the monitor volume levels.

Your goal is so that they would be a bit more present in the stage-monitor mix:
* Either increase the overall monitor level
* Or increase their level in the monitor
* Or lower something that is too loud

An alternative reason can be:

* An overworking compressor on the channel.
* A too high (or low) low-cut.
* An unfortunate equalizer setting.

# After the rehearsal

## Save the scene

* We have one scene that we never overwrite, that is the **CCP Service READONLY**.
* We load it, but we save it over on another scene, the **CCP Service**. (That's the "weekly working preset")
* Never overwrite the READONLY one please.

On the console:

* Press **VIEW** at the "Scenes" section.
* With the "Save" knob, scroll to the "**CCP Service**" (without the "<ins>READONLY</ins>" part).
* Press the "Save" knob to save it.
* Press the "Backspace" knob to delete "READONLY" from the name, if needed.
* Press the "Save" knob.
* Press the "Confirm" knob.

## Closing up

After the event is finished, please follow the [closing up procedure](closingup.md).
