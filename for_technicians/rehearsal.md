# Before they arrive
You should be there ~20mins before them, to be able to set up

### Set up the SPL meter
* Turn it on
* Put it to it's place


### Other things
 * Mute  the pulpit microphone, to avoid feedbacking


## At the stage
* Reset the stage (see [resetting](resetting.md))
* Set up stage to be usable by the musicians
     * Set up correct mic hights
     * Move away obstacles
     * Fold back unused microphones
     * Check stands
    * Check monitor alignments

# After they arrive
 * Be nice, connect with them personally.
 * Help them with what ever they ask.
 * **Align the microphones**
   * Very important!
   * Align height and direction, so that the microphone is in line with the mouth, and points towards them.
   * Meanwhile, keep it in a way so that the sound from the monitor would hit the microphone from the back as much as possible.
 * **Set instrument controls to neutral**
   * Some instruments have equalizers on them, ask the owner to turn it off, or set it to "flat".
   * Some instruments have volume controls on them, ask the owner to set it to neutral, or middle.
   * And ask the owners of the instruments, not to change any of those during performing.
   
## Gain staging
 * Set the Main fader to 0
 * Go through all channels (vocal/instruments), and set a proper gain.
   * Ask them one-by-one to play from lowest to highest volume.
   * You only care about their highest, but asking from lowest to highest usually helps them in producing more precise levels.
   * When they are at the highest, they should hit **-18db**
   * **Gain should generally be left alone after this point.**

## During worship
 * Constantly monitor that everything sounds right.
 * Check if the vocalists have the microphone aligned well.  
 * Set up a mix that sounds well while keeping eye on the SPL meter
 * Check if they need any help
   * Stuck cables
   * Microphone alignment
 * Verify that the stage isn't too loud
   * Sometimes mute the MAIN channel, to see if the stage is too loud or not.
   * If an instrument or vocalist fills the room just from the monitors, ask them or help them adjust it.
    
    
### If a vocalist sounds off-key or unexpected
Our singers are quite good and checked, so if they sound bad,
that is most likely due to them not hearing themselves correctly.

To solve this: go up on the stage and check the monitor levels.
The target is for them to be a bit more loud.
 * Either increase the overall monitor level
 * Or increase their level in the monitor
 * Or lower something that is too loud


## After the rehearsal
### Save the preset

**DO NOT OVERWRITE THE CCP Service MAIN PRESET**

* Press VIEW at the "Scenes" section
* With the "Save" knob, scroll to the "CCP Service" (without the "MAIN")
* Press the knob to save it
* Press the "backspace" knob to delete "MAIN" from the name
* Press the "save" knob
* Press confirm
