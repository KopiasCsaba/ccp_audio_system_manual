# Before they arrive
You should be there ~20mins before them, to be able to set up
everything professionally and to avoid hurry-induced errors, fix random issues, etc.

 * Follow the "[Turning on the audio system](../labels/turningon.pdf)" guide posted on the mixer door.

## At the main console

### Set up the sound pressure level meter
* Turn it on following the numbers on the buttons.
    * The two 1s need to be pressed together, until the "n" shows up.
    * Then wait until it initializes.
    * Then press 2 and 3.
* Put it to the counter and watch it always.


### Load the main scene
Load the "CCP Service MAIN" scene.

 * Press VIEW at the "Scenes" section
 * With the "Load" knob, scroll to the "CCP Service MAIN"
 * Press the knob to load it
 * Press confirm

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Load vocal and instrument presets

Consult with the worship leader on:
 * Who will be at which mic on the stage
 * Who will use which instrument


#### Load Vocalists
 * Select the **VOCALS** layer 
 * Load the appropriate preset for the channels, see: Loading a preset

#### Load Instruments
* Select the **Instruments** layer
* Load the appropriate preset for the channels, see: Loading a preset


#### Loading a preset
 * **Mute** and pull down all channels that will not be used.
   * Only do this on Mic 1-6, and Instruments 1-5
   * Don't change/mute the piano, DrumTB and other stuff.
   

 * **Select** a channel
 * Press **VIEW** on the EQUALIZER section.
 * Press the **UTILITY** button next to the screen.
 * With the (first) "scope" knob, select the **RECALL SCOPE**.
 * Press the knob to select **all scopes**.
 * Select the appropriate preset, e.g.: "VOC ..." or "GTR ...".
 * Press second knob to load it.
 * Press **confirm**

After the initial setup, you might want to save the preset, see "[Save the preset](#save-the-preset)" at the end of this document on how.

### Other things
 * Mute the preaching mics, to avoid feedbacking.


## At the stage
* Reset the stage (see: [resetting](resetting.md))
* Set up stage to be usable by the musicians
     * Set up correct mic hights
     * Move away obstacles
     * Fold back unused microphones
     * Check stands
    * Check monitor alignments

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# After they arrive
 * Be nice, connect with them personally.
 * Help them with what ever they ask.
 * **Align the microphones**
   * Very important!
   * Align height and direction, so that the microphone is in line with the mouth, and points towards them. Ideally it points  bottom up.
   * Meanwhile, keep it in a way so that the sound from the monitor would hit the microphone from the back as much as possible.
 * **Set instrument controls to neutral**
   * Some instruments have equalizers on them, ask the owner to turn it off, or set it to "flat".
   * Some instruments have volume controls on them, ask the owner to set it to neutral, or middle.
   * And ask the owners of the instruments, not to change any of those during performing.
   
## Gain staging

 * Set the Main fader to 0.
 * Usually no need to gain-stage the drums and the keyboard.
 * Go through all channels (vocal/instruments), and set a proper gain.
   * Ask them one-by-one to play from lowest to highest volume.
   * You only care about their highest, but asking from lowest to highest usually helps them in producing more precise levels.
   * When they are at the highest, they should hit **-18db**.
   * **Gain should generally be left alone after this point.**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## During worship
 * Constantly monitor that everything sounds right.
   * **PUT YOUR HEAD OUT** of the cave for that!
 * Check if the vocalists have the microphone aligned well.  
 * Set up a mix that sounds well while keeping eye on the SPL meter, the limits are written on it.
 * Check if they need any help, e.g.:
   * Stuck cables
   * Microphone alignment
   * Volume issues
 * Verify that the stage isn't too loud
   * Sometimes mute the MAIN channel, to see if the stage is too loud or if one source is overpowering the others on the stage.
   * If an instrument or vocalist fills the room just from the monitors, ask them or help them adjust it.
 * PUT YOUR HEAD OUT of the cave! :)
    
    
### If a vocalist sounds off-key or unexpected
Our singers are quite good and checked, so if they sound bad,
that is most likely due to them not hearing themselves correctly.


To solve this: go up on the stage and check the monitor levels.
The target is for them to be a bit more loud.
 * Either increase the overall monitor level
 * Or increase their level in the monitor
 * Or lower something that is too loud

An alternative reason can be:
 * An overworking compressor on the channel
 * A too high (or low) lowcut
 * An unfortunate equalizer setting

## After the rehearsal
### Save the preset

 * We have one preset that we never overwrite, that is the **CCP Service MAIN**.
 * We load it, but we save it over on the **CCP Service**.
 * Never overwrite the MAIN one please.

On the console:

* Press **VIEW** at the "Scenes" section.
* With the "Save" knob, scroll to the "**CCP Service**" (without the "<ins>MAIN</ins>").
* Press the knob to save it.
* Press the "backspace" knob to delete "MAIN" from the name, if needed.
* Press the "save" knob.
* Press confirm.

### Turn off the system
* Follow the "[Turning off the audio system](../labels/turningoff.pdf)" guide posted on the mixer door.
