# Upload the video

Upload the video to our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064617556957&sk=videos).
If the video is on vimeo already, you could ask Vimeo to upload it to our
channel. [Learn more](vimeo.md#publish-from-vimeo-to-youtube-and-facebook).

# Set video details

Please follow the guidelines in [video metadata templates](video_metadata_templates.md).

# Manage the live recording

**@TODO:** Check out how exactly we should do this on facebook, and update this.

We most probably streamed the recording, so if you have properly uploaded, published the recording as a video, then
please make the relevant LIVE recording
unlisted.

# Scheduling the facebook live events

Every half year or so, we should re-create the "Church Service" recurring event.

* Event name: Church Service
* Press Recurring event
    * Weekly
    * sundays
    * From 10:00 AM
    * To 12:00PM
    * Start date next sunday
    * End date: bit more than half year ahead (depending on how much it lets you to set)


* Description:

```
The real service will start at 10:30 AM, the live stream starts 30 min earlier so that you could tune in on time.

You can find the live stream at:
https://facebook.com/100064617556957/live_videos

We also stream to YouTube:
https://youtube.com/@calvarychapelpaphos6683/streams

Join us in real life, or through the live stream!
```

* Settings -> Stream -> Use persistent stream key (!!!)
* Create Event
* Return to home

Now there is right now a bug in facebook, even though it shows it will go automatically live after the creation of the
event, it won't.
The solution seems to be to go back a second time, and enable it.

* At the page view, "Live video"
* Scheduled broadcasts
* Select the just created one
* Three dots -> view
* Set up live video
* Turn on "Automatically go live"
* Save

**@TODO:** add images to describe this.
