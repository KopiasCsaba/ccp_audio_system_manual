<h1>Managing Vimeo</h1>
<hr>



# Upload the video

Upload the video to our [vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/user133790558).

# Set video details

Please follow the guidelines in [video metadata templates](video_metadata_templates.md).

# Add it to the proper playlist

Playlists are called showcase in vimeo.

And you can edit them under the [Showcases](https://vimeo.com/manage/showcases) admin panel menu.

* Sunday messages go to "Sunday Messages"
* Mathitís classes go to their respective playlists and to "Mathitís - School of Discipleship"

# Publish from Vimeo to YouTube and Facebook

* Go to the [Library](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos) of videos
* On the right column there is a "publish to social" option if you move your mouse there.

* Select the proper platforms (YouTube and Facebook)
* And push through the steps

# Fix missing info
Vimeo does not appear to set thumbnails on the pushed videos, you need to set those manually.
