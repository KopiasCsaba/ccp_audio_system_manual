# Upload the video

Upload the video to
our [vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/user133790558).

# Set video details

Please follow the guidelines in [video metadata templates](video_metadata_templates.md).

# Add it to the proper playlist

**@TODO:** Find out if vimeo supports playlists, and make them just like on youtube.

* Sunday messages go to "Sunday Messages"
* Mathitís classes go to their respective playlists and to "Mathitís - School of Discipleship"
