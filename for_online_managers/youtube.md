# Upload the video

Upload the video to our [channel](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC0uEys0VihIMmJFFL1Swj8g/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D).
If the video is on vimeo already, you could ask Vimeo to upload it to our channel. [Learn more](vimeo.md#publish-from-vimeo-to-youtube-and-facebook).


# Set video details

Please follow the guidelines in [video metadata templates](video_metadata_templates.md).

Important: The order in which you "publish" videos are important, as
that will be the final unchangeable "video date", and it determines the order 
in which the videos will be listed.

So please make sure to keep the order of recordings as much as possible to reflect
their real in-time order.

If possible please add timestamps.Then the user can jump to the part he would like to. This is kind of a manual process. Go trough the video and look at which time something starts and note it down in the description. 
Usually the timestampes are like this:
0:00 Welcome & announcements
11:58 Worship 1
35:50 Preaching
1:34:50 Prayer
1:38:43 Worship 2
1:43:00 Outro & blessing


# Add it to the proper playlist

* Sunday messages go to "Sunday Messages"
* Mathitís classes go to their respective playlists and to "Mathitís - School of Discipleship"

# Manage the live recording

We most probably streamed the recording, and that can be found in the "LIVE" tab of the youtube studio.

If you have properly uploaded, published the recording as a "VIDEO", then please make the relevant LIVE recording "
unlisted".
