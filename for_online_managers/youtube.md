# Upload the video

Upload the video to our [channel](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC0uEys0VihIMmJFFL1Swj8g/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D).
If the video is on vimeo already, you could ask Vimeo to upload it to our channel. [Learn more](vimeo.md#publish-from-vimeo-to-youtube-and-facebook).


# Set video details

Please follow the guidelines in [video metadata templates](video_metadata_templates.md).

# Add it to the proper playlist

* Sunday messages go to "Sunday Messages"
* Mathitís classes go to their respective playlists and to "Mathitís - School of Discipleship"

# Manage the live recording

We most probably streamed the recording, and that can be found in the "LIVE" tab of the youtube studio.

If you have properly uploaded, published the recording as a "VIDEO", then please make the relevant LIVE recording "
unlisted".
