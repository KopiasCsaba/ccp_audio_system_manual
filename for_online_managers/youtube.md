# Upload the video

Upload the video to our [channel](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC0uEys0VihIMmJFFL1Swj8g/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D).
If the video is on vimeo already, you could ask Vimeo to upload it to our channel. [Learn more](vimeo.md#publish-from-vimeo-to-youtube-and-facebook).


# Set video details

Please follow the guidelines in [video metadata templates](video_metadata_templates.md).

Important: The order in which you "publish" videos are important, as
that will be the final unchangeable "video date", and it determines the order 
in which the videos will be listed. Therefore always publish the **OLDEST** one first before pulishing a newer one e.g.: first publish 03.10.2023 and then 08.10.2023.

So please make sure to keep the order of recordings as much as possible to reflect
their real in-time order.

# Add it to the proper playlist

* Sunday messages go to "Sunday Messages"
* Mathitís classes go to their respective playlists and to "Mathitís - School of Discipleship"

Example:
"Please add my screenshot"

# Manage the live recording

We most probably streamed the recording, and that can be found in the "LIVE" tab of the youtube studio.

If you have properly uploaded, published the recording as a "VIDEO", then please make the relevant LIVE recording "
unlisted".
