# 1) Download the recording

From [StreamPcObsRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNNs13uH2axNPDnkZgHyR10jpfO7UVrc)

# 2) Trim beginning and end if needed

* Beginning: Before the person doing the announcements just about to start to speak
* End: After the "Thank you for joining us" end screen, or after the blessing prayer from 2Cor13:14.

Use the free, open-source tool called [LosslessCut](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut), to edit the video.

Learn how to install LosslessCut [here.](installing_losslesscut.md)

1. Start LosslessCut
2. File -> Open
3. Select the video file
4. Mark regions:
    * Mark IN point
        * Move the playhead to the position where you want the IN point to be.
        * Fine-tune the alignment with the keyframe buttons.
            * <img src="assets/video/llc-keyframe-buttons.png">
        * Mark the beginning by pressing the "Start current segment" button.
            * <img src="assets/video/llc-buttons-in.png">

    * Mark OUT point
        * Move the playhead to the position where you want the OUT point to be.
        * Fine-tune the alignment with the keyframe buttons.
            * <img src="assets/video/llc-keyframe-buttons.png">
        * Mark the end by pressing the "End current segment" button.
            *  <img src="assets/video/llc-buttons-out.png">

You can have multiple regions, if you want to cut something out, but most of the time we only trim the beginning and the
end.

You should reach something like this:

The file will be saved next to where you have downloaded the video.
