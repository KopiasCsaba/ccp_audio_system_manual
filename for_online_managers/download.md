# How to know if you have anything to do?

If there are any new recordings in the [StreamPcOBSRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNNs13uH2axNPDnkZgHyR10jpfO7UVrc) or [OtherRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17gQgmRwi3JmZXZ_OICUVdbewtcM3omxd?usp=sharing) folders mentioned below,
then you can work with them. Check the church's schedule to know when things happen.

Currently, the regular events are as follows:
 * Sunday services
 * Tuesday, Thursday bible-school
