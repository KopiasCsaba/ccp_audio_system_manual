<h1>Managing Google drive</h1>

# Check

1. Make sure, that you have uploaded the edited video to the [EditedRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uiSQAJTFtMKRcx1BCm3R-SwR9kuvnIYf) folder.


2. If you didn't need to edit, just copy from [StreamPcObsRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNNs13uH2axNPDnkZgHyR10jpfO7UVrc) to the [EditedRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uiSQAJTFtMKRcx1BCm3R-SwR9kuvnIYf), and set a proper file name as shown [here](video_editing.md#5-upload-the-recording).


3. Make sure, that you have uploaded the thumbnail (if you made it) to the [Thumbnails](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G_yGUalItjvr9RIatlAt7c1_WIkqtqAj) folder.

# Clean up

If and only if a recording is published everywhere properly, and the edited version is uploaded, you can delete it from the StreamPcObsRecordings folder.
     
The StreamingPc uploads copies of the recordings to StreamPcObsRecordings, but
retains the recordings outside of this folder. 
So **deleting from StreamPcObsRecordings does not make us loose the recording**. 

But it is necessary to clean this folder up as it will fill up eventually otherwise.

Practically the Google Drive is just a temporary transfer medium to help us 
remotely get the recordings, and edit them.

Now the "EditedRecordings" folder and the "Thumbnails" folder is for the other direction,
we need to have the edited videos uploaded to there. 
And everyonce in a while, we'll archive them, but you don't need to do that, just
make sure everything is up-to-date in EditedRecordings and Thumbnails.

And then, regularly we'll download it, put it to backup storage and make room for others.
Warn Peter or Csaba about it if the space would run out of Google Drive due to the lack of doing this:)
