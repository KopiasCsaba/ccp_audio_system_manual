<h1>Managing Google drive</h1>



# 1) Upload the recording & thumbnail to the archive

We archive our recordings together with the thumbnails regularly from google drive, thats why
we ask you to **always upload** the edited files to this drive folder also.

Please upload/copy:
 * The edited recording
 * The thumbnail

to the Google Drive folder [ArchivedRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uiSQAJTFtMKRcx1BCm3R-SwR9kuvnIYf).

<b>Naming</b>:

Please use the following file naming system:

Template:

`YYYY-MM-DD $TITLE - $PASSAGE - $PASTOR_NAME`

Example:

`2023-07-30 Right with God - Romans 3:9-31 - Pastor Stephen Clarke`


# Clean up

If and only if a recording is published everywhere properly, and the edited version is uploaded, you can delete it from the StreamPcObsRecordings folder.
     
The Streaming PC uploads copies of the recordings to [StreamPcObsRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hNNs13uH2axNPDnkZgHyR10jpfO7UVrc?usp=drive_link), but
retains the recordings outside of this folder, locally.
So **deleting from StreamPcObsRecordings does not make us loose the recording**. 

But it is necessary to clean this folder up as it will fill up eventually otherwise.

Practically the Google Drive is just a temporary transfer medium to help us 
remotely get the recordings, and edit them and upload for archival.

Now the [ArchivedRecordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uiSQAJTFtMKRcx1BCm3R-SwR9kuvnIYf?usp=drive_link) folder is for the other direction,
we need to have the edited videos uploaded to there. 


And then, regularly we'll download it, put it to backup storage and make room for others.
Warn Peter or Csaba about it if the space would run out of Google Drive due to the lack of doing this:)
